# FeedForward-Neural-Network
This is a simple diabetes detection model using a feedforward (dense) neural network
There's no real correlation between given data and outcome (diabetes test) as shown in histogram (in ipynb file); hence, it'll be useful to implemet a machine learning model that can draw a relationdhip for us.
